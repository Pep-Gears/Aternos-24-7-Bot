## 📋 Overview
Welcome to the Aternos-24-7-Bot project. This bot uses Mineflayer to keep your Aternos Minecraft server running all day, every day. It connects to your server with your chosen IP, port, and password. The bot prevents your server from going idle by mimicking player activity. When it gets kicked, it automatically rejoins. It even leaves and joins at random times to keep things lively.
